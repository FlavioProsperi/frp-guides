# frp-guides

This respository collects tutorials, guidelines, examples, patterns and half-baked ideas on functional reactive programming (FRP).

The focus is on FRP libraries written in [Haskell][], using the style originally pioneered by Conal Elliott, and developed e.g. in [reactive-banana][], [frpnow][] or [sodium][] libraries.
