FRP Guides
==========

This respository collects tutorials, guidelines, examples, patterns and half-baked ideas on functional reactive programming (FRP).

At the moment, it is organized a bit like a curated Wiki. If you've found a nice code pattern, or a cool link, don't hesitate to make a pull request.

The focus is on FRP libraries written in [Haskell][], using the style originally pioneered by Conal Elliott, and developed e.g. in the [reactive-banana][], [frpnow][] or [sodium][] libraries.
